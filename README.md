Replication 2 for Gov 1006

This repository contains a replication of the code used to create two tables in Ryan Enos's article, "Causal effect of intergroup contact on exclusionary attitudes."

The rmd file contains code which reads in the data, contained in the dataverse folder, obtained from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DOP4UB and creates the Figure 1 and Figure 2 of the article in gt format. 

The html file contains only the two tables output from this code.
